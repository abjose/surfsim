surfsim
=======

surfsim is a small circuit-builder allowing the creation and composition of a graph of filtering circuit elements. This project is being created as a summer project in the Meister lab at Caltech, and is ultimately meant to simplify the process of creating and testing the behavior of simulated retinal microcircuits.

Currently the project is script/CLI only, but the goal is to build a light GUI on top for making features more accessible to non-coders.
